* Install and verify Terraform on your laptop. https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html. Terraform does not have an installer. You simply place the file in a directory that is on your $PATH. What is $PATH? It is an environment variable that lists all the directories where applications might be found. I recommend /usr/local/bin on the Mac and C:\Program Files on the PC. You will need administrative privileges to modify either; I expect you to know or figure out how to do this.
