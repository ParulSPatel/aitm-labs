= Lab 03 instructor notes

You will likely need to re-run startup.sh to regenerate a new machine with an updated apt-get update

(yes, could do this more efficiently by just forcing it for the machine every time - )

Be sure to delete

$ rm -rf .vagrant.d

and then reinstall

$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf

Why?


Delivery notes 10/2/2015. Many students were able to complete this lab in an hour or so. Recommend extending it with the full pipeline as originally intended, and then doing behavior-driven development fully in Lab 04. Will require further work.

continuous improvement: consider drawing a picture showing how internal ports & curl within the vagrant VM relate to external mappings & curl.
