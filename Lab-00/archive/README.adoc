= Lab 00 notes

This lab is a simple, "get them started" lab that nevertheless requires detail orientation. Some of it is specific to the institution, but some is more general (ssh access is a common need.)

The pwOn.bash and pwOff.bash scripts may be useful to quickly turn cleartext challenge/response logins briefly on while students are configuring their ssh keys. NOT RECOMMENDED to leave on for more than a minimum length of time!!!

I don't like relying on external installation resources but time is pressing. May rewrite them as time permits.



CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT FEEDBACK FOR Spring 2016:

* Test this well
* Provide an overview of the objectives
* Explain the basic Unix commands when first used
* consider not linking to other resources
* not using vi
* add discussion of passwd vs ssh
